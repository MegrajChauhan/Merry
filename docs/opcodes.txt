NOTE: The register indexing can be done by just 4 bits as there are only 16 registers available to the program.
NOTE: Most instructions have variants. For eg: add_imm and add_reg which can be generalized into add.

FLAGS REGISTER:
The contents of the flag register depends on the architecture. But the general contents of it are: carry flag, zero flag, overflow flag, negative flag and greater flag.
Compare instructions and arithmetic instructions can affect the state of these flags.

nop -> opcode = 0x00
       every value of the other 7 byte is ignored.
       Does nothing

halt -> opcode = 0x01
        stops the core and if the core is the only one running, the VM stops

add_imm  -> opcode: 0x02
            operands: One register and one immediate
            register: The lower four bits of the second byte.
            immediate: 4 bytes immediate in the lower 4 bytes[Can be expanded into 6 bytes immediate at most]
            example: 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0xDD -> add 0xAABBCCDD to whatever is in the Ma[as indicated by the lower 4 bits of the second byte].             

[Changes made here: Things should be easier with this]
add_reg  -> opcode: 0x03
            operands: two registers
            register 1: The upper four bits of the last byte.
            register 2: The lower four bits of the last byte.
            example: 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 -> add the contents of Mb register to Ma register[because the last byte is 0x01-> 0b00000001]

move_imm_64 -> opcode: 0x1B
               operands: one register and a 64 bits value that follows the instruction in the memory.
               example: 0x1B 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 -> Move 64 bits immediate into Ma[as represented by the lower 4 bits of the 8th byte]
                        immediately after this instruction, the 64-bit value must follow i.e say 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0xDD 0xEE 0xFF 0x00 0x01
                        These 8 bytes will be moved into Ma.

move_reg -> opcode: 0x1C
            operands: two registers
            details: moves the entire 8 bytes from one register to another.
            example: 0x1C 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 -> Here in the last byte 0x01, which is 0b0000_0001. So, from Mb(0001) register, source, 8 bytes are moved into Ma(0000), destination.

               operands: destination register and a 8 bit value.
               example: 0x20 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x1D -> sign extend 0x1D to 8 bytes and store it in Mf register.

movesx_imm16 -> opcode: 0x21 : same as  movesx_imm8 but with 2 bytes immediate value.

   UPDATE:
   Now, movesx_regX uses the lowest byte for encoding registers.
}
movesx_reg8 -> opcode: 0x23
               operands: 2 registers
               example: 0x23 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 -> Here the last byte, 0x01 which is 0b0000_0001. This implies the source is the Mb register and destination is Ma register.
               This instruction moves the lower 1 byte from the destination register while sign extending it[Clears the upper bytes of the destination register].

movesx_reg16: opcode: 0x24 : same as movesx_reg8 but moves 2 bytes instead.
movesx_reg32: opcode: 0x25 : same as movesx_reg8 but moves 4 bytes instead.

NOTE: movezx is unnecessary but the general move instruction can be aliased with movezx.

jmp_off -> opcode: 0x26
           operands: a 6 byte immediate
           details: This jmp variants requires a 6 byte immediate which is treated as a signed number i.e the 0th bit is the sign bit.
                    The immediate is sign extended as per the sign and then added to the pc.
           example: 0x26 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 -> The last 6 bytes are the offset. Since it is a signed value, providing 2's complemented negative value will decrement the PC.

[Changes made here]

                The value is then written to the destination register. The offset is 2 bytes long at most and it is treated as unsigned.
       example: 0x2A 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x07 -> Subtract "0x00 0x07" from BP and put it into register 0x03[Mc].

svc -> opcode: 0x2B
       operands: The same as sva at the exact same byte position.
       details: SVC(Stack Variable Change) is used to change the value of a variable on the stack. Works in the same way as sva except the value in the register is written to that offset in stack.

push_imm -> opcode: 0x2C
            operands: a 6 bytes immediate.
            example: 0x2C 0x00 [6 bytes of immediate] -> The 6 bytes of immediate is pushed onto the stack.

           operands: the source register which is also the destination register and a 64-bit value that follows the instruction in the memory.
           example: 0x31 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01
                    0x00 0xFf 0xAA 0x10 0x11 0xEE 0x00 0x04 -> Performs AND operation on the value in register 0x01[Mb] and the following value.

          example: 0x38 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x0F -> Takes the value from register 0x01[Mb] and shifts it by 0x0F position. It is recommended that this value is never greater than 64.
                   The result is stored in the source register.

rshift -> opcode: 0x39: same as rshift but performs right shift instead.

{
   Memory details:
   Both the data memory and the instruction memory are divided into pages of 1MB. The larger the program the more pages is allocated by the VM to fit it all.
   Same applies for the data in the program, the more data it has the more pages are allocated to fit it all. Even if the program has no data a simgle page is still allocated so that if the program wants to store anything, it can.
   The instruction memory is inaccessible to the program but the whole data memory belongs to it. Every byte is addressible in the data memory i.e address 12345 would address the 12345th byte in the first page. This allows for 1048576 addresses.
   Now, it is recommended that the addresses are 8 bytes aligned. Here is why: Say the program is requesting the byte 102. As the VM is 64-bit, 8 bytes are read at once i.e byte 102 through 109. This is completely fine but it is not 8 byte aligned.
   By 8 bytes aligned, I mean the address should be a multiple of 8 i.e 8, 16, 24, 32....
   Now say the program requests to read the byte 1048574. As the VM tries to read the corresponding 8 bytes, it finds that the read exceeds the boundary of the page and thus an error is thrown.
   For the sake of simplicity, the program can assume that the memory is linear meaning the program can think of the memory as an array of bytes rather than a group of bytes divided into different pages. So using the address 1048577 would access
   the first byte from the second page. Though the error of the page boundary access still remains.  
}

[
  A few aliases that I would like to set:
  When I am Nibble Encoding, I am referring to the encoding of two registers in 1 byte i.e say 0x01 which would be 0b0000_0001 is encoding 2 registers; 0000 and 0001 namely Ma and Mb.
  So if I say 8th byte Nibble Encoding then I am saying that the 8th byte of the instruction encodes two registers as mentioned above.

[These are the only instructions for now.]

[The following will describe interrupts, services, what each does and the interrupt conventions]
Merry has an internal manager that manages the entire machine. It tells each core when to start, stop and is the brain of Merry. Ultimately the manager has the task of providing services to the
program that is running on the machine. Every single service that doesn't require the cores like IO, Networking, File handling, Multi-threading, Dynamic library loading, OS communication, etc
is provided by the manager and as such the programs require a way to request for a service. Now, the possible side-effects of having a central hub for such critical services mandates careful
consideration of the machine's performance as it may hinder the efficiency and the speed of the running program rendering the machine useless as a problem solving tool.

                    Whatever is in the given address is compared with whatever is in the Mb register. If they are equal, the value at the address
                    is replaced by the value in Mc register. If the values are not equal, whatever is in the register Mb is replaced by whatever is in
                    the given address. This is an atomic operation.

[It is not guranteed that floating point instructions will work correctly across different host]
fadd32 -> opcode: 0x89 -> only takes 2 registers encoded exactly as add_reg. 
fsub32 -> opcode: 0x8A -> only takes 2 registers encoded exactly as add_reg. 
fmul32 -> opcode: 0x8B -> only takes 2 registers encoded exactly as add_reg. 
fdiv32 -> opcode: 0x8C -> only takes 2 registers encoded exactly as add_reg. 

NOTE: The mentioned floating point arithmetic affect only 2 flags. Hence the following instructions should work after them:
jnz, jz, jne, je, jng, jg, jns, js, jge, jse 

Interrupt numbers/IDs:
Each interrupt number/ID represents a unique service that the Manager can provide. Numbers 0-150 are reserved for internal use and thus the interrupts that the program can use start from 151.
If a program were to use any interrupt from 0-150, the manager will handle it as an error and abruptly exit. This behaviour could be utilized for error handling and thus they will be explained in the
future. For now here are the interrupt:

Interrupt Number |               Details         
    151                 HALT: Causes the core that makes this request to exit. If only one core was running to begin with then the VM exits.
                        If the request causes the VM to stop, the requesting core's Ma register should contain the return value. The HALT instruction produces the same behaviour.
    152                 EXIT: Causes the VM to exit. The same behaviour as HALT except every core running will be stopped and the VM exits. Just like 151, the requesting core's Ma register
                        must have the return value.
    153                 NEW_CORE: Creates a new virtual core that can start running from the point specified by the program. The address for the new core to start executing from should be in the Ma
                        register of the requesting core. After the request is fulfilled, Ma of the requesting core will contain 1 if the request was a success otherwise it will contain 0.
